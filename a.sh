# My Dotfiles Setup Script
#
# This script automates the setup of my configuration files and tools.
# It performs the following actions:
#   1. Detects the Linux distribution (Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu, Arch).
#   2. Installs all necessary dependencies, including build tools.
#   3. Uses GNU Stow to symlink configuration files into the correct locations.
#      - Links user configs to the $HOME directory.
#      - Links system-wide configs to the /etc directory using sudo.
#   4. Compiles and installs dwm and slock from the source in the repo.
#   5. Applies distribution-specific tweaks (e.g., for Fedora's bash files).
#
# Usage:
#   ./setup.sh
#
# ==============================================================================

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
