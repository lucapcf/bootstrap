# My Dotfiles + Setup Script

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for a customized Linux environment. The `setup.sh` script automates the installation of necessary dependencies, symlinks the configurations, and sets up key tools.

## **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Potential Data Loss and System Instability ‚ö†Ô∏è**

**This setup script makes significant changes to your system, including installing packages, modifying configuration files, and symlinking directories. Running it may:**

* **Overwrite or delete existing files** in your home directory or other system locations.
* **Break existing programs or configurations** due to conflicts or changes in dependencies.
* **Lead to system instability or render your system unbootable** if not used carefully or if unforeseen issues arise.
* **Prevent the repository from being renamed, relocated, or deleted** without breaking the symlinks and losing your configuration changes.

**It is strongly recommended that you:**

* **BACK UP ALL IMPORTANT DATA** before running this script.
* **Understand what the script does** before executing it. Review `setup.sh` thoroughly.
* **Use this script on a fresh installation or a virtual machine** if you are unsure.
* **Proceed at your own risk.** The author is not responsible for any damage or data loss that may occur.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Distribution Support**: Automatically detects and adapts installations for Fedora, Debian, and Arch Linux.
* **Automated Dependency Installation**: Installs core tools (git, stow), X.Org server, build essentials, and a suite of desktop applications (Alacritty, Neovim, Waybar, Wofi, xbindkeys, fastfetch etc).
* **Hybrid Desktop Environment/Window Manager Setup**: Supports the installation of Hyprland (Wayland) and Cinnamon (X11), along with compiling `dwm` and `slock` from source.
* **GNU Stow Integration**: Uses GNU Stow to intelligently symlink configuration files from this repository to their correct locations in your home directory (`$HOME`) and system-wide (`/etc`).
* **Nerd Font Installation**: Automatically downloads and installs Ubuntu Mono Nerd Font for enhanced terminal aesthetics and icon support.
* **Modular Bash Configuration**: Organizes bash configuration files into `~/.config/.bashrc.d` directory for cleaner management of aliases, functions, and environment variables.
* **Interactive Session Selector**: The startup script `start_menu` allows interactive selection between different desktop environments/window managers (Hyprland, dwm, Cinnamon) upon console login.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A fresh installation of Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu-based, or Arch Linux.
* Sudo privileges
* `git` should be installed (the setup script will attempt to install it if missing).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lucapcf/bootstrap.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the dotfiles directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/bootstrap
    ```

3.  **Run the setup script:**
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```
    The script will:
    * Detect your operating system and package manager.
    * Prompt for `sudo` password when necessary for package installations and system-wide symlinks.
    * Install all required software.
    * Symlink your dotfiles into place.
    * Compile and install `dwm` and `slock` (if their source directories exist in your dotfiles).
    * Install Ubuntu Mono Nerd Font.

## üõ†Ô∏è Post-Installation

1.  **Reboot or Log Out:** For all changes to take effect, especially environment variables and font installations, it is highly recommended to **reboot your system or log out and log back in**.
2.  **Terminal Font:** Configure your terminal emulator (e.g., Alacritty, Kitty) to use "UbuntuMono Nerd Font" or "UbuntuMono Nerd Font Mono".
3.  **Neovim Plugins:** Open Neovim and run `:checkhealth` or allow your plugin manager to install plugins.
