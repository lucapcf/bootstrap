# My Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (dotfiles) for a streamlined and customized Linux environment. The `setup.sh` script automates the installation of necessary dependencies, symlinks the configurations, and sets up key tools.

## ‚ú® Features

* **[span_0](start_span)Multi-Distribution Support**: Automatically detects and adapts installations for Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, and Arch Linux[span_0](end_span).
* **[span_1](start_span)Automated Dependency Installation**: Installs core tools (git, stow), X.Org server, build essentials, and a suite of desktop applications (Alacritty, Kitty, Neovim, Picom, tmux, Waybar, Wofi, Feh, xbindkeys, fastfetch)[span_1](end_span).
* **[span_2](start_span)Hybrid Desktop Environment/Window Manager Setup**: Supports the installation of Hyprland (Wayland) and Cinnamon (X11), along with compiling `dwm` and `slock` from source[span_2](end_span).
* **[span_3](start_span)GNU Stow Integration**: Uses GNU Stow to intelligently symlink configuration files from this repository to their correct locations in your home directory (`$HOME`) and system-wide (`/etc`)[span_3](end_span).
* **[span_4](start_span)Nerd Font Installation**: Automatically downloads and installs Ubuntu Mono Nerd Font for enhanced terminal aesthetics and icon support[span_4](end_span).
